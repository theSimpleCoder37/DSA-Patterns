### **Step 1: Understanding the Problem (Breaking It Down)**

#### **Tell a Simple Story**

Imagine you have a line of children waiting to get a piece of candy. Each child is wearing a jersey with a number on it. The children are already lined up in order based on their jersey number. So, all the children with jersey #1 are together, then all the children with #2, and so on.

The rule is: **only one child for each jersey number can get candy**.

Your job is to rearrange the line *in place*. This means you can't create a whole new line of children. You must ask the children to move around in their existing line. Your goal is to move all the children with unique jersey numbers to the front of the line.

After you're done, you need to tell me the **count** of how many children are at the front of the line (the unique ones). It doesn't matter who is standing at the back of the line after the unique ones.

#### **Explain the Parts**

* **Inputs (What we get):**
    * We are given a list of numbers. In C++, this is a `std::vector<int>`, which we can call `nums`.
    * A very important clue is that this list is **already sorted** from smallest to largest.

* **Outputs (What we must return):**
    * We must return a single integer, let's call it `k`.
    * This number `k` is the count of how many unique numbers are in the list.

* **The Goal (The main task):**
    * We need to change the *original* `nums` list.
    * The first `k` elements of `nums` must become the unique numbers, in their original order.
    * We don't care about the elements in the list *after* the `k`-th position.

#### **Show with a Drawing**

Let's say our input list `nums` is: `[1, 1, 2, 3, 3]`

The unique numbers are `1`, `2`, and `3`. There are **3** of them. So, `k` should be `3`.

Our job is to change the `nums` list so the first `3` elements are `1`, `2`, and `3`.

**BEFORE:**
`nums = [ 1, 1, 2, 3, 3 ]`

**AFTER:**
`nums = [ 1, 2, 3, ?, ? ]`  // The first 3 elements are the unique numbers.
                           // The `?` means we don't care what's in those spots.

The function should `return 3`.

#### **List the Tricky Cases (Edge Cases)**

We should always think about the strange or simple inputs that might break our code.

1.  **An empty list:** What if `nums = []`? There are no numbers, so there are no unique numbers. The result should be `k = 0`.
2.  **A list with only one number:** What if `nums = [5]`? There is one unique number, `5`. The result should be `k = 1`, and the list stays as `[5]`.
3.  **A list with all the same numbers:** What if `nums = [2, 2, 2, 2]`? There is only one unique number, `2`. The result should be `k = 1`, and the list should be changed to `[2, ?, ?, ?]`.
4.  **A list with no duplicates at all:** What if `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]`? All numbers are unique. The result should be `k = 4`, and the list doesn't need to change.

---

### **Step 2: The First, Simple Solution (The Brute-Force Way)**

#### **Explain the Simple Idea**

The easiest way to get only the unique numbers is to use a helper tool. In C++, there's a special kind of list called a `set`. A `set` has a magic property: **it automatically refuses to store any duplicate items**. If you try to add a number that's already in the set, it just ignores it.

So, our simple plan is:

1.  Create a new, empty `set`.
2.  Go through our input list `nums` from beginning to end.
3.  Add each number from `nums` into our `set`. The `set` will automatically take care of the duplicates for us.
4.  Once we are done, the `set` will hold only the unique numbers. The number of items in the set is our answer, `k`.
5.  Finally, we copy the unique numbers from the `set` back into the beginning of the original `nums` list, as the problem requires.

#### **Write the C++ Code**

Here is the C++ code for this simple idea.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <set> // WHY: We need to include the <set> library to use a set.

class Solution {
public:
    int removeDuplicates(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        // WHY: A std::set is a perfect tool for automatically getting unique elements.
        // It's a data structure that only stores one of each value.
        std::set<int> unique_elements;

        // WHY: This loop goes through every number in our input list `nums`.
        for (int num : nums) {
            // WHY: We insert each number into the set. If the number is already
            // there, the set simply ignores it. This is how we filter out duplicates.
            unique_elements.insert(num);
        }

        // WHY: The size of the set is exactly the number of unique elements we found.
        // This is the 'k' value we need to return.
        int k = unique_elements.size();

        // WHY: Now, we need to modify the original `nums` array.
        // This loop copies the unique elements from our set back into `nums`.
        int index = 0;
        for (int unique_num : unique_elements) {
            nums[index] = unique_num;
            index++;
        }

        // WHY: We return 'k', which is the count of unique elements.
        return k;
    }
};
```

#### **Show a Detailed "Dry Run"**

Let's walk through an example: `nums = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3]`

1.  **Start:** We create an empty set: `unique_elements = {}`.
2.  **Loop 1:** The first number in `nums` is `1`. We add it to our set.
      * `unique_elements` is now `{1}`.
3.  **Loop 2:** The next number is `1`. We try to add it, but `1` is already in the set, so the set ignores it.
      * `unique_elements` is still `{1}`.
4.  **Loop 3:** The next number is `2`. We add it to our set.
      * `unique_elements` is now `{1, 2}`. (Sets also keep things sorted\!)
5.  **Loop 4:** The next number is `2`. The set ignores it.
      * `unique_elements` is still `{1, 2}`.
6.  **Loop 5:** The next number is `3`. We add it to our set.
      * `unique_elements` is now `{1, 2, 3}`.
7.  **End of Loop:** We've checked all numbers.
8.  **Get `k`:** We ask for the size of `unique_elements`. It's `3`. So, `k = 3`.
9.  **Copy Back:** We copy the numbers from `unique_elements` back to `nums`.
      * `nums[0] = 1`
      * `nums[1] = 2`
      * `nums[2] = 3`
10. **Final `nums`:** The beginning of `nums` is now `[1, 2, 3, ...]`.
11. **Return:** The function returns `k`, which is `3`.

#### **Analyze Speed and Memory (The Easy Way)**

  * **Time (Speed):** To add one number to a `set`, it takes about $\\log M$ steps, where $M$ is the size of the set. Since we do this for all $N$ numbers in our list, the total work is roughly $N \\times \\log N$. So we say the time complexity is $O(N \\log N)$. This is pretty good, but not the best possible.

  * **Space (Memory):** We created a whole new data structure, `unique_elements`, to hold the unique numbers. In the worst case (if all numbers in `nums` are unique), this `set` will grow to be the same size as the input list. This means we use extra memory proportional to the input size, $N$. We call this $O(N)$ space complexity.

The main problem with this solution is the **extra memory**. The question hints that we should try to solve it "in-place," meaning without creating a big new list.

-----

### **Step 3: Thinking Towards a Better Way (The Expert's Thought Process)**

#### **Find the Slow Part**

First, let's look at our previous solution. What was its main weakness?

It was the **extra memory**. We created a whole new `set` just to hold the unique numbers. The problem asks us to modify the list **"in-place,"** which is a big clue that the best solution shouldn't use a lot of extra memory. The $O(N)$ extra space is what we want to fix.

#### **Reveal the "Aha\!" Idea**

An expert would immediately ask: "What is the most important clue the problem gives us?"

The clue is: **The input array is already sorted.**

This is a huge advantage\! Why? Because it means all the duplicate numbers are guaranteed to be sitting right next to each other.

For example, in `[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3]`, all the `0`s are together, all the `1`s are together, and so on.

  * **The Thought Process:**
      * "Since duplicates are clumped together, I don't need a `set` to find them. I can just compare a number to the one right before it."
      * "How can I remove the duplicates without using a new list? I can overwrite the duplicates with the next unique number I find."
      * "Let's try to build the final list of unique numbers at the very beginning of the *same* array."

This leads to the core idea: We can use **two pointers** (or two indices) to manage this process.

1.  **The "Writer" Pointer (let's call it `k`):** This pointer marks the end of our "unique numbers" section. It tells us where the *next* unique number should be placed. It starts at index 1, because the very first element in the array is always unique.

2.  **The "Reader" Pointer (let's call it `i`):** This pointer will travel through the entire array from the second element (`i=1`) to the end, *reading* every number.

Here's the plan: The reader `i` moves along. We compare the number it's currently reading, `nums[i]`, to the *last unique number we've saved*. The last unique number is at `nums[k-1]`.

  * If `nums[i]` is **DIFFERENT** from `nums[k-1]`, we have found a new unique number\! So, we copy it into the writer's position: `nums[k] = nums[i]`. Then we move the writer pointer forward: `k++`.
  * If `nums[i]` is the **SAME** as `nums[k-1]`, it's a duplicate. We do nothing. We just move the reader `i` to the next number, effectively ignoring and leaving the duplicate behind.

#### **Draw the New Idea**

Let's visualize this with `nums = [1, 1, 2, 3, 3]`.

We'll use `k` for the writer and `i` for the reader. `k` also happens to be the count of unique elements found so far.

**Initial State:** The first element (`1`) is always unique. So our unique section has 1 element. `k` starts at `1`. The reader `i` also starts at `1`.

```
k = 1
i = 1

nums: [ 1,  1,  2,  3,  3 ]
        ^   ^
      k-1   i
```

**Comparison:** Is `nums[i]` (which is `1`) different from `nums[k-1]` (which is `1`)?
**Answer:** No, they are the same. It's a duplicate. We do nothing but move the reader `i` forward.

-----

**Next Step:** `k` stays put. `i` moves to `2`.

```
k = 1
i = 2

nums: [ 1,  1,  2,  3,  3 ]
        ^       ^
      k-1       i
```

**Comparison:** Is `nums[i]` (`2`) different from `nums[k-1]` (`1`)?
**Answer:** Yes\! It's a new unique number.
**Action:**

1.  Copy the value from `i` to position `k`: `nums[k] = nums[i]` (so, `nums[1] = 2`).
2.  Move the writer `k` forward. `k` becomes `2`.

The array now looks like this: `[ 1,  2,  2,  3,  3 ]`. `k` is now `2`.

-----

**Next Step:** `k` is `2`. `i` moves to `3`.

```
k = 2
i = 3

nums: [ 1,  2,  2,  3,  3 ]
            ^       ^
          k-1       i
```

**Comparison:** Is `nums[i]` (`3`) different from `nums[k-1]` (`2`)?
**Answer:** Yes\! Another unique number.
**Action:**

1.  Copy `nums[i]` to `nums[k]`: `nums[2] = 3`.
2.  Move `k` forward. `k` becomes `3`.

The array now looks like: `[ 1,  2,  3,  3,  3 ]`. `k` is now `3`.

-----

**Next Step:** `k` is `3`. `i` moves to `4`.

```
k = 3
i = 4

nums: [ 1,  2,  3,  3,  3 ]
                ^       ^
              k-1       i
```

**Comparison:** Is `nums[i]` (`3`) different from `nums[k-1]` (`3`)?
**Answer:** No. It's a duplicate. Just move `i` forward.

-----

**End:** The reader `i` has reached the end of the array. The final value of `k` is `3`. This is our answer\! The front of the array is now `[1, 2, 3]`.

This method avoids using any extra memory by cleverly overwriting the array itself.

-----
### **Step 4: The Smart Solution (The Optimized Code)**

This solution uses the **Two Pointers** idea we just discussed. It's highly efficient because it solves the problem in a single pass through the list, using no extra memory.

#### **Write the Optimized C++ Code**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    int removeDuplicates(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        // WHY: First, handle the tricky edge case of an empty list.
        // If the list is empty, there are 0 unique elements.
        if (nums.empty()) {
            return 0;
        }

        // WHY: 'k' is our "writer" pointer. It also counts the number of unique
        // elements found so far. We start it at 1 because the first element
        // (at index 0) is always unique by itself.
        int k = 1;

        // WHY: We start our "reader" pointer 'i' at the second element (index 1)
        // and go to the end of the list.
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            
            // WHY: This is the core logic. We compare the current element `nums[i]`
            // with the last-known unique element, which is at `nums[k-1]`.
            if (nums[i] != nums[k - 1]) {
                // If they are different, we have found a new unique number.

                // WHY: We place this new unique number at the 'k' position,
                // overwriting a duplicate that was there before.
                nums[k] = nums[i];

                // WHY: We move our "writer" pointer forward because our section
                // of unique numbers has now grown by one.
                k++;
            }
            // If nums[i] is the same as nums[k-1], it's a duplicate.
            // We do nothing and just let the loop move 'i' to the next element.
        }

        // WHY: After the loop finishes, 'k' holds the final count of unique elements.
        return k;
    }
};
```

#### **Give a Simple Analogy**

This technique is a classic pattern called **Two Pointers**.

Think of it like two workers on an assembly line.

  * Worker **`i`** (the reader) looks at *every single item* on the conveyor belt.
  * Worker **`k`** (the writer) stands by a new shipping box. `k` only packs an item if it's a *new type* of item they haven't packed yet.

Worker `i` picks up an item and shows it to `k`. If it's different from the last item `k` packed, `k` puts it in the box. Otherwise, `i` just lets the duplicate item fall off the end of the belt. The final count of items in the box is our answer.

#### **Show the "Dry Run"**

Let's trace the code with `nums = [0, 0, 1, 1, 2]`.

1.  **Start:** `nums` is not empty. `k` is set to `1`. The `for` loop starts with `i = 1`.

      * `k = 1`, `i = 1`
      * `nums = [0, 0, 1, 1, 2]`

2.  **Loop (i=1):**

      * Compare `nums[i]` (value `0`) with `nums[k-1]` (value `0`).
      * Are they different? No. It's a duplicate. Do nothing.

3.  **Loop (i=2):**

      * Compare `nums[i]` (value `1`) with `nums[k-1]` (value `0`).
      * Are they different? Yes\! It's a new unique number.
      * **Action:** Set `nums[k]` to `nums[i]`. So, `nums[1] = 1`.
      * **Action:** Increment `k`. `k` is now `2`.
      * `k = 2`, `i = 2`
      * `nums` is now `[0, 1, 1, 1, 2]`

4.  **Loop (i=3):**

      * Compare `nums[i]` (value `1`) with `nums[k-1]` (value `1`).
      * Are they different? No. Duplicate. Do nothing.

5.  **Loop (i=4):**

      * Compare `nums[i]` (value `2`) with `nums[k-1]` (value `1`).
      * Are they different? Yes\! New unique number.
      * **Action:** Set `nums[k]` to `nums[i]`. So, `nums[2] = 2`.
      * **Action:** Increment `k`. `k` is now `3`.
      * `k = 3`, `i = 4`
      * `nums` is now `[0, 1, 2, 1, 2]`

6.  **End of loop:** The loop finishes. The function returns the final value of `k`.

7.  **Return:** `3`. The first `k=3` elements of `nums` are `[0, 1, 2]`, which is correct.

#### **Compare Speed and Memory**

  * **Time (Speed):** The "reader" pointer `i` goes through the list only once. So, if the list has $N$ numbers, we do about $N$ steps. This is **$O(N)$ time**. This is a huge improvement from the $O(N \\log N)$ time of our first solution\!

  * **Space (Memory):** Look at our code. Did we create any new lists or sets? No. We only used a few variables to hold single numbers (`k`, `i`). This takes up constant extra memory. We call this **$O(1)$ space**. This is perfect, as it meets the "in-place" goal of the problem.

|            | Simple Solution | Smart Solution |
| :--------- | :-------------- | :------------- |
| **Time** | $O(N \\log N)$   | **$O(N)$** |
| **Memory** | $O(N)$          | **$O(1)$** |

### **Step 5: How to Explain Your Solution (The Interview Plan)**

Imagine an interviewer asks you to solve this problem. Here is a clear, step-by-step template you can use to explain your smart solution.

#### **Provide a Clear Template**

1.  **The Goal:**
    > "The goal of this problem is to remove all duplicate elements from a **sorted** array. We need to do this **in-place**, meaning we can't use extra memory for a new array. Finally, we need to return the count of the unique elements."

2.  **My Solution Idea:**
    > "Since the array is sorted, all the duplicates will be grouped together. This is a big clue. My approach is to use the **Two Pointers** technique. It's a very common and efficient pattern for problems involving sorted arrays."

3.  **How it Works:**
    > "I use two pointers, or indices. You can think of them as a 'reader' and a 'writer'.
    >
    > - The **writer pointer, `k`,** keeps track of the next position to place a unique number. It starts at index 1.
    > - The **reader pointer, `i`,** iterates through the entire array to inspect every element.
    >
    > As the reader `i` moves along, I compare its value, `nums[i]`, to the value of the last unique element we saved, which is at `nums[k-1]`. If the values are different, it means I've found a new unique element. I then copy this new element to the writer's position, `nums[k]`, and increment the writer `k`. If the values are the same, it's a duplicate, so I do nothing and just let the reader `i` move on."

4.  **Performance:**
    > "This solution is very efficient.
    > - The **time complexity is $O(N)$**, because the reader pointer visits each of the N elements in the array exactly once.
    > - The **space complexity is $O(1)$**, because I modify the array in-place and only use a couple of variables for the pointers. This meets the problem's memory requirements perfectly."

5.  **Tricky Cases:**
    > "I also handled the main edge case: if the input array is empty, my code correctly returns 0."

---
### **Step 6: Key Lessons and Future Problems**

#### **The Main Pattern**

The key pattern to remember from this problem is the **Two Pointers** technique. This is one of the most powerful and common patterns for array problems. It allows you to solve problems that seem to require extra memory or nested loops in a much more efficient way.

The big lesson is: When you see a **sorted array**, your mind should immediately think, *"Can I use Two Pointers?"*

#### **Clues for Next Time**

How do you spot a problem where this pattern might work? Look for these clues:

* **The Input:** The problem explicitly states you are given a **sorted array**. This is the biggest hint.
* **The Task:** The problem asks you to modify an array **"in-place"**, or it involves tasks like removing or partitioning elements.
* **The Goal:** You need to find pairs or groups of elements that meet certain criteria (e.g., a pair that sums to a target, or in our case, a group of duplicates).

Whenever you see these clues, the Two Pointers technique should be one of the first things you try.

#### **One More Problem**

A great way to solidify a new skill is to practice it on a slightly different problem. A perfect next step is:

* **Problem to try:** **[80. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II]**

This problem is very similar, but with a small twist: you are allowed to keep up to **two** duplicates of each number instead of just one. It will force you to adapt the two-pointer logic we just learned.
