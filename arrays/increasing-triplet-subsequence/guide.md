### **Step 1: Understanding the Problem (Breaking It Down)**

Before we write any code, we need to be 100% sure we understand what the problem is asking.

#### **Tell a Simple Story**

Imagine you are at a parade, and people are walking by one after another. Each person has a different height. Your job is to watch the parade and answer one simple question: did you ever see three people walk by, one after the other, where the first person was shorter than the second, and the second person was shorter than the third?

The people must appear in the correct order. For example, if you see a short person, then a tall person, and then a medium-height person, that doesn't count. You need to see `short`, then `medium`, then `tall`, in that specific order.

#### **Explain the Parts**

Let's break down the problem into its main components:

*   **`Inputs`**: We are given a list of numbers. In C++, this is a `std::vector<int> nums`. For our story, this is the list of heights of the people in the parade, in the order they appear.
    *   Example Input: `nums = [5, 2, 8, 3, 4]`

*   **`Outputs`**: We must return a simple "yes" or "no" answer. In programming, this is a boolean value: `true` (yes, we found such a triplet) or `false` (no, we didn't).

*   **`Goal`**: The main task is to find out if there are three numbers in the list, let's call them `nums[i]`, `nums[j]`, and `nums[k]`, that satisfy two conditions at the same time:
    1.  They appear in order in the list: `i < j < k`.
    2.  They are strictly increasing in value: `nums[i] < nums[j] < nums[k]`.

#### **Show with a Drawing**

Let's visualize this with an example. Imagine our list of numbers is `nums = [2, 7, 3, 5, 4, 8]`.

We are looking for three numbers that are getting bigger, from left to right.

```
nums:  [2,  7,  3,  5,  4,  8]
Index:  0   1   2   3   4   5
```

Let's try to find a triplet:
*   Can we start with `2`? We need a number bigger than `2` that comes after it. Let's pick `3`. Now we need a number bigger than `3` that comes after it. Let's pick `5`.
*   We found a triplet!
    *   `nums[0]` is `2` (our `i`)
    *   `nums[2]` is `3` (our `j`)
    *   `nums[3]` is `5` (our `k`)
*   Check the conditions:
    1.  Order of appearance: `0 < 2 < 3`. This is true.
    2.  Increasing value: `2 < 3 < 5`. This is also true.
*   Since we found one, the answer for this example is `true`.

Another valid triplet in the same list would be `(2, 5, 8)`. We only need to find one.

#### **List the Tricky Cases (Edge Cases)**

We should always think about the strange inputs that could break our code.

*   **Short Lists:** What if the list has fewer than 3 numbers? For example, `[10, 20]`. It's impossible to pick 3 numbers, so the answer must be `false`.
*   **Empty List:** What if the list is empty: `[]`? Again, we can't pick 3 numbers, so the answer must be `false`.
*   **Decreasing List:** What if the numbers are always going down, like `[10, 8, 6]`? We can never find an *increasing* triplet, so the answer must be `false`.
*   **All Same Numbers:** What if the list is `[7, 7, 7, 7]`? The problem says `nums[i] < nums[j] < nums[k]`. The numbers must be *strictly* increasing. Since `7` is not less than `7`, the answer must be `false`.
*   **Negative Numbers:** The numbers can be negative. For example, in `[-5, -3, 0, -10]`, the triplet `(-5, -3, 0)` is a valid increasing triplet.

### **Step 2: The First, Simple Solution (The Brute-Force Way)**

When you're new to a problem, the best first step is to think of a simple, direct solution, even if it's not the fastest. We call this the "brute-force" approach because it uses raw computing power to check every possibility.

#### **Explain the Simple Idea**

The simplest way to solve this is to check every single possible combination of three numbers in the list. We can do this with three loops:

1.  The first loop will pick our first number, `nums[i]`.
2.  The second loop will pick our second number, `nums[j]`. To make sure it comes *after* the first number, this loop will only look at numbers with an index `j` that is greater than `i`.
3.  The third loop will pick our third number, `nums[k]`. To make sure it comes *after* the second number, this loop will only look at numbers with an index `k` that is greater than `j`.

Inside the innermost loop, we will check if our three chosen numbers are increasing: `nums[i] < nums[j] < nums[k]`. If they are, we've found our answer, and we can immediately stop and return `true`.

If we finish all the loops and never find such a triplet, it means one doesn't exist, so we return `false`.

#### **Write the C++ Code**

Here is the C++ code that does exactly what we just described.

```cpp
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    bool increasingTriplet(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        // WHY: Get the size of the list once to avoid calling .size() repeatedly.
        int n = nums.size();

        // WHY: If the list has fewer than 3 elements, it's impossible to find a triplet.
        // This is an edge case check to prevent errors and save time.
        if (n < 3) {
            return false;
        }

        // WHY: This is the outer loop to pick the FIRST number of our potential triplet.
        // It goes from the start of the list up to the third-to-last element.
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 2; ++i) {

            // WHY: This is the middle loop to pick the SECOND number.
            // It starts from `i + 1` to ensure that our second number appears *after* our first number.
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n - 1; ++j) {

                // WHY: This is the inner loop to pick the THIRD number.
                // It starts from `j + 1` to ensure it appears *after* the second number.
                for (int k = j + 1; k < n; ++k) {

                    // WHY: This is the main condition check.
                    // We check if the three numbers we picked are strictly increasing.
                    if (nums[i] < nums[j] && nums[j] < nums[k]) {
                        // WHY: If we find even one valid triplet, our job is done.
                        // We can stop searching and return true immediately.
                        return true;
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        // WHY: If we finish all three loops without finding a triplet,
        // it means no such triplet exists. So, we return false.
        return false;
    }
};
```

#### **Show a Detailed "Dry Run"**

Let's walk through an example to see the code in action. Let `nums = [5, 1, 6, 2]`.

1.  `n` becomes `4`. `4` is not less than `3`, so we continue.
2.  **Outer loop (i):** `i` starts at `0`. `nums[i]` is `5`.
    *   **Middle loop (j):** `j` starts at `i + 1 = 1`. `nums[j]` is `1`.
        *   **Inner loop (k):** `k` starts at `j + 1 = 2`. `nums[k]` is `6`.
            *   We check: `nums[i] < nums[j] && nums[j] < nums[k]`?
            *   Is `5 < 1` and `1 < 6`? No, `5 < 1` is false. We continue.
        *   **Inner loop (k):** `k` becomes `3`. `nums[k]` is `2`.
            *   We check: `nums[i] < nums[j] && nums[j] < nums[k]`?
            *   Is `5 < 1` and `1 < 2`? No, `5 < 1` is false. We continue.
        *   Inner loop for `k` is done.
    *   **Middle loop (j):** `j` becomes `2`. `nums[j]` is `6`.
        *   **Inner loop (k):** `k` starts at `j + 1 = 3`. `nums[k]` is `2`.
            *   We check: `nums[i] < nums[j] && nums[j] < nums[k]`?
            *   Is `5 < 6` and `6 < 2`? No, `6 < 2` is false. We continue.
        *   Inner loop for `k` is done.
    *   Middle loop for `j` is done.
3.  **Outer loop (i):** `i` becomes `1`. `nums[i]` is `1`.
    *   **Middle loop (j):** `j` starts at `i + 1 = 2`. `nums[j]` is `6`.
        *   **Inner loop (k):** `k` starts at `j + 1 = 3`. `nums[k]` is `2`.
            *   We check: `nums[i] < nums[j] && nums[j] < nums[k]`?
            *   Is `1 < 6` and `6 < 2`? No, `6 < 2` is false. We continue.
        *   Inner loop for `k` is done.
    *   Middle loop for `j` is done.
4.  The outer loop for `i` is now finished (`i` only goes up to `n-2`, which is 2. `i=2` would make `j=3`, `k=4`, which is out of bounds).
5.  Since we never returned `true`, we now execute the final line: `return false;`.

This example shows that for `[5, 1, 6, 2]`, there is no increasing triplet.

#### **Analyze Speed and Memory (The Easy Way)**

*   **Time (Speed):** We have three loops, one nested inside the other.
    *   The `i` loop runs about `N` times (where `N` is the number of items in the list).
    *   For each of those `N` times, the `j` loop runs about `N` times.
    *   For each of *those*, the `k` loop runs about `N` times.
    *   So, the total amount of work is roughly $N \times N \times N$, which is $N^3$. We write this as **$O(N^3)$**.
    *   **Is this good or bad?** It's very slow. If your list has 1,000 numbers, you'd be doing roughly 1,000 * 1,000 * 1,000 = 1 billion checks! This will be too slow for large inputs.

*   **Space (Memory):** How much extra memory did we use?
    *   We created a few variables to keep track of our loops (`n`, `i`, `j`, `k`).
    *   The amount of memory we use doesn't change if the list has 10 items or 1 million items. It's a fixed, small amount.
    *   When the extra memory usage is constant like this, we call it **$O(1)$** space. This is excellent.

---


### **Step 3: Thinking Towards a Better Way (The Expert's Thought Process)**

#### **Find the Slow Part**

The brute-force solution was slow because of the three nested loops.

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < n - 2; ++i) {
    for (int j = i + 1; j < n - 1; ++j) {
        for (int k = j + 1; k < n; ++k) { // <-- SLOW PART
            // ...
        }
    }
}
```

The problem is that for every pair of numbers `(nums[i], nums[j])`, we are searching the *rest of the entire list* (`k` loop) to find a third number. This is a massive amount of repeated work. An expert problem-solver would immediately ask: **"How can we get the answer by looking at each number in the list just once?"**

#### **Reveal the "Aha!" Idea**

Let's rethink our goal. We need to find `i < j < k` such that `nums[i] < nums[j] < nums[k]`.

Instead of picking three numbers and checking if they work, let's walk through the list one number at a time and ask, "What role could this current number play in a triplet?"

Let's say we are looking at a number `num` from the list.
*   Could `num` be the **third** number in our triplet (`nums[k]`)?
*   For `num` to be the third number, we must have *already seen* two other numbers before it, let's call them `first` and `second`, such that `first < second < num`.

This means as we walk through the list, we only need to keep track of the best possible `first` and `second` numbers we've seen so far.

Here's the clever thought process:

1.  Let's create two variables to hold the best candidates for the first and second numbers of our triplet. Let's call them `first_candidate` and `second_candidate`.
2.  What makes a "good" candidate? We want them to be as small as possible! A smaller `first_candidate` makes it easier to find a `second_candidate` that is bigger than it. A smaller `second_candidate` makes it easier to find a third number that is bigger than it.
3.  So, we'll initialize `first_candidate` and `second_candidate` to a very large number (like infinity) to begin with.
4.  Now, we'll walk through our list `nums` one number at a time. For each `num`:
    *   **Case 1: `num` is smaller than or equal to our `first_candidate`.**
        *   This `num` is a new, even better candidate for the first number in a triplet because it's so small. So, we update `first_candidate = num`. We can't form a triplet yet, but we've found a better starting point for a future triplet.
    *   **Case 2: `num` is bigger than `first_candidate` but smaller than or equal to our `second_candidate`.**
        *   This `num` can't be our first number (it's too big), but it's a great new candidate for our second number! It's better than our old `second_candidate` because it's smaller, making it easier to find a third number later. So, we update `second_candidate = num`.
    *   **Case 3: `num` is bigger than `first_candidate` AND bigger than `second_candidate`.**
        *   **Aha!** This is the magic moment. We have found our triplet!
        *   We already have a `first_candidate`.
        *   We already have a `second_candidate` (and we know `second_candidate > first_candidate`).
        *   And now, the current `num` is greater than `second_candidate`.
        *   So, we have found `first_candidate < second_candidate < num`. This is our increasing triplet. We can immediately stop and return `true`.

If we get through the entire list without Case 3 ever happening, it means no such triplet exists, and we can return `false`.

#### **Draw the New Idea**

Let's trace this new idea with the list `nums = [2, 7, 3, 5, 4, 8]`.

We have two variables: `first_candidate` and `second_candidate`. Let's start them at `infinity`.

```
first_candidate = ∞
second_candidate = ∞
```

1.  **Current number is `2`:**
    *   `2` is smaller than `first_candidate` (∞). So, it's a great new first number.
    *   `first_candidate` becomes `2`.
    *   `[2, 7, 3, 5, 4, 8]`
       `^`
    *   State: `first_candidate = 2`, `second_candidate = ∞`

2.  **Current number is `7`:**
    *   `7` is larger than `first_candidate` (2).
    *   `7` is smaller than `second_candidate` (∞). So, it's a great second number.
    *   `second_candidate` becomes `7`.
    *   `[2, 7, 3, 5, 4, 8]`
          `^`
    *   State: `first_candidate = 2`, `second_candidate = 7` (We have found an increasing pair: `2 < 7`)

3.  **Current number is `3`:**
    *   `3` is larger than `first_candidate` (2).
    *   `3` is smaller than `second_candidate` (7). So, it's a *better* second number. Why? Because it's easier to find a number larger than 3 than it is to find one larger than 7.
    *   `second_candidate` becomes `3`.
    *   `[2, 7, 3, 5, 4, 8]`
             `^`
    *   State: `first_candidate = 2`, `second_candidate = 3` (We have found a new increasing pair: `2 < 3`)

4.  **Current number is `5`:**
    *   `5` is larger than `first_candidate` (2).
    *   `5` is larger than `second_candidate` (3).
    *   **Aha!** We found it. We have `first_candidate` (2), `second_candidate` (3), and now `5`.
    *   `2 < 3 < 5`. This is an increasing triplet. We can stop and return `true` right now.

This approach lets us find the answer in just one pass through the list!

---

### **Step 4: The Smart Solution (The Optimized Code)**

This solution uses our "Aha!" idea to solve the problem by walking through the list only once.

#### **Write the Optimized C++ Code**

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <limits> // WHY: We need this to get the largest possible integer value (our "infinity").

class Solution {
public:
    bool increasingTriplet(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        // WHY: Get the size of the list. If it's too small, a triplet is impossible.
        // This is the same edge case check as before.
        if (nums.size() < 3) {
            return false;
        }

        // WHY: Initialize two variables to act as our candidates for the first and second
        // numbers in the triplet. We set them to the largest possible integer value to ensure
        // that the first number we see in the list will be smaller.
        int first_candidate = std::numeric_limits<int>::max();
        int second_candidate = std::numeric_limits<int>::max();

        // WHY: We use a single loop to go through each number in the list just once.
        for (int num : nums) {
            // This is the core logic from our "Aha!" idea.
            
            if (num <= first_candidate) {
                // WHY: This number is smaller than or equal to our best 'first' candidate so far.
                // We update our 'first' candidate to this new, smaller number.
                // This gives us a better starting point for a future triplet.
                first_candidate = num;
            } else if (num <= second_candidate) {
                // WHY: This number is bigger than our 'first' candidate, but smaller than or
                // equal to our 'second' candidate. This is a better 'second' number.
                // We update 'second_candidate' because a smaller second number makes it
                // easier to find a third number that's larger than it.
                second_candidate = num;
            } else {
                // WHY: The current number is larger than both `first_candidate` and `second_candidate`.
                // This means we have successfully found all three numbers of our increasing triplet.
                // The triplet is (first_candidate, second_candidate, num).
                // We can stop immediately and return true.
                return true;
            }
        }

        // WHY: If we finish the entire loop without ever entering the `else` block,
        // it means we never found a third number to complete a triplet. So, no such triplet exists.
        return false;
    }
};
```

#### **Give a Simple Analogy**

I call this pattern the **"Patient Hunter"** approach.

Imagine you are a hunter looking for three animals of increasing size: a rabbit, a fox, and a bear, who must appear in that order.

*   You set a small trap for a rabbit (`first_candidate`).
*   You wait. The first animal you see is a tiny rabbit. You catch it. Your `first_candidate` is now this rabbit.
*   Next, a fox appears. It's bigger than your rabbit. Now you have your `second_candidate`. You have found your `(rabbit, fox)` pair.
*   Then, a slightly smaller rabbit comes by. You are a smart hunter! You let your first rabbit go and catch the new, smaller one. Why? Because a smaller first animal makes it easier to find a second and third animal that are bigger. Your `first_candidate` is updated.
*   Finally, a huge bear walks by. It's bigger than your current rabbit (`first_candidate`) and your fox (`second_candidate`). You've found your triplet!

This is exactly what our code does. It patiently waits, always updating its "traps" (`first_candidate` and `second_candidate`) with the best (smallest) options it has seen so far.

#### **Show the "Dry Run"**

Let's use a trickier example: `nums = [20, 100, 10, 12, 5, 13]`

Initially:
`first_candidate = INT_MAX`
`second_candidate = INT_MAX`

1.  **`num` is 20**: It's `<= first_candidate`.
    *   `first_candidate` becomes `20`.
    *   State: `first = 20`, `second = INT_MAX`

2.  **`num` is 100**: It's `> first_candidate` (20) and `<= second_candidate` (INT_MAX).
    *   `second_candidate` becomes `100`.
    *   State: `first = 20`, `second = 100`. (We have a potential pair `20 < 100`).

3.  **`num` is 10**: It's `<= first_candidate` (20).
    *   `first_candidate` becomes `10`.
    *   State: `first = 10`, `second = 100`.
    *   **This is the most important step!** We have found a *better* start for a triplet. Our `second_candidate` (100) is still valid because we know it appeared *after* a smaller number (the 20).

4.  **`num` is 12**: It's `> first_candidate` (10) and `<= second_candidate` (100).
    *   `second_candidate` becomes `12`.
    *   State: `first = 10`, `second = 12`. (We now have a much better pair `10 < 12`).

5.  **`num` is 5**: It's `<= first_candidate` (10).
    *   `first_candidate` becomes `5`.
    *   State: `first = 5`, `second = 12`.

6.  **`num` is 13**: It's `> first_candidate` (5) and also `> second_candidate` (12).
    *   **BINGO!** We enter the `else` block. We have found a triplet.
    *   The triplet is formed by `first_candidate < second_candidate < num`. So, `5 < 12 < 13`.
    *   The code returns `true`.

Notice that the final triplet `(5, 12, 13)` isn't exactly what the variables held for their indices, but that doesn't matter. We just need to prove that *some* triplet exists. The logic guarantees that by the time we find a `num > second_candidate`, we must have already seen some `i` and `j` that came before it in the right order.

#### **Compare Speed and Memory**

Let's compare this to our first attempt.

| | Brute-Force Solution | Optimized Solution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Time (Speed)** | $O(N^3)$ (Very Slow) | **$O(N)$ (Very Fast)** |
| **Space (Memory)**| $O(1)$ (Excellent) | **$O(1)$ (Excellent)** |

The improvement in speed is enormous. If our list has 1 million numbers:
*   $N^3$ is a million * a million * a million... impossible to calculate.
*   $N$ is just 1 million operations. This is instant on a modern computer.

We made the code incredibly fast without using any extra memory. This is a huge win!

### **Step 5: How to Explain Your Solution (The Interview Plan)**

If an interviewer asks you to solve this problem, you don't want to just write the code. You want to walk them through your thought process. Here is a simple, step-by-step template you can follow to sound clear, confident, and smart.

#### **Provide a Clear Template**

Here's your recipe for explaining the solution:

1.  **The Goal:** Start by restating the problem in your own words. This shows you've understood the request.
    *   "The goal is to find out if there are three numbers in a list that are in increasing order, both by their position in the list and by their value."

2.  **My Solution Idea:** Describe your high-level approach. Name the technique if you can.
    *   "My approach is to solve this in a single pass through the list, which is very efficient. I'll use a greedy strategy where I keep track of the best possible first and second numbers of a triplet I've seen so far."

3.  **How it Works:** Explain the logic of your code step-by-step.
    *   "I'll use two variables, let's call them `first` and `second`, which will store the smallest possible values for the first two parts of an increasing triplet. I'll initialize them to a very large number, like infinity."
    *   "Then, I'll loop through each number in the input list just once. For each number `num`:"
        *   "If `num` is smaller than `first`, I'll update `first` to `num`. This gives me a better, smaller start for a new potential triplet."
        *   "If `num` is bigger than `first` but smaller than `second`, I'll update `second` to `num`. This gives me a better, smaller middle for a potential triplet."
        *   "Finally, if `num` is bigger than both `first` and `second`, it means I've found my answer. The triplet exists, and I can immediately return `true`."
    *   "If I get through the whole list without this third condition ever happening, it means no such triplet exists, and I'll return `false`."

4.  **Performance:** Analyze the efficiency of your solution.
    *   "This solution is very fast because its **time complexity is $O(N)$** since I only iterate through the list one time."
    *   "It's also very memory-efficient. The **space complexity is $O(1)$** because I only use a couple of extra variables, no matter how big the input list is."

5.  **Tricky Cases:** Show that you've thought about edge cases.
    *   "My code also handles the edge case where the input list has fewer than three elements. In that situation, it's impossible to form a triplet, so I correctly return `false` at the beginning."

### **Step 6: Key Lessons and Future Problems**

The goal of solving problems isn't just to get a green checkmark; it's to learn a reusable pattern that you can apply to other problems in the future.

#### **The Main Pattern**

The key pattern here is a **Greedy Approach with State Maintenance**.

Let's break that down:
*   **Greedy:** At every step, we make the choice that seems best at that moment. We greedily updated our `first_candidate` to be the smallest number possible. We did the same for our `second_candidate`. We didn't worry about whether this choice would be perfect for the future; we just made the "best" local choice. In this problem, that simple greedy choice was enough to find the solution.
*   **State Maintenance:** The "state" is the small amount of information we carried with us as we looped. Our entire state was just two variables: `first_candidate` and `second_candidate`. This is the core of the optimization. Instead of looking back at the whole array again and again, we condensed all the useful information from the part of the array we had already seen into just two numbers.

#### **Clues for Next Time**

How do you know when to use this pattern again? Look for these clues in a problem description:

*   **"Find a subsequence..."**: The word "subsequence" means the elements do not have to be next to each other (unlike a "subarray" or "substring"). This often hints that you can process elements one by one.
*   **"...of length K"**: The problem might ask for a triplet (length 3), a quadruplet (length 4), or some other fixed-length sequence. This pattern of holding `K-1` candidates is very powerful.
*   **"Does it exist?"**: Problems that ask for a `true` or `false` answer are often simpler than problems that ask you to count all possibilities or find the "best" one. This simplicity is a clue that a greedy one-pass approach might work.
*   **Order matters**: When the problem states a condition like `i < j < k`, it's a signal that you should process the array in a single direction (from left to right).

#### **One More Problem**

If you want to master this pattern, a great next problem to try is **[300. Longest Increasing Subsequence]**.

*   **How it's similar:** It also asks about finding an increasing subsequence in an array.
*   **How it's different (and harder):** Instead of just finding if a subsequence of length 3 exists, you must find the length of the *longest possible* increasing subsequence.
*   **Why it's good practice:** It will force you to expand on today's "state maintenance" idea. You'll need to keep track of more than just two candidate numbers, but the core thinking process of building up the best possible subsequences as you iterate is the same.
