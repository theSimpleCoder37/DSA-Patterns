### **Step 1: Understanding the Problem (Breaking It Down)**

First, let's make sure we understand exactly what the problem is asking us to do.

#### **Tell a Simple Story**

Imagine a classroom full of students, and everyone is holding up a card with a number on it. Let's say the numbers are `[2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]`.

Your job is to find the number that appears on **more than half** of the cards.

In this class, there are 7 students. "More than half" means more than `7 / 2 = 3.5`. So, any number that appears 4 or more times is our winner.

If we count the cards:

  - Number `1` appears 3 times.
  - Number `2` appears 4 times.

Since `2` appears 4 times (which is more than 3.5), the majority number is `2`. That's the number you have to find and report back.

#### **Explain the Parts**

  * **`Inputs`:** We are given a list of numbers. In C++, this is called a `vector<int>`, which is just a fancy name for a list that can grow or shrink. Let's call our input list `nums`.

  * **`Output`:** We need to return a single number—the one that is the majority element.

  * **`Goal`:** Find the number in the list that appears **more than `n / 2` times**, where `n` is the total number of items in the list. The problem statement guarantees that such an element always exists.

#### **Show with a Drawing**

Let's visualize the example `[2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]`. There are 7 elements.

The "halfway" mark is `7 / 2 = 3.5`. We need a number that appears more than this many times.

```
Numbers: [ 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2 ]
           ^  ^              ^  ^
           |  |              |  |
           +--+--------------+--+---- Count of '2' is 4.

Numbers: [ 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2 ]
                 ^  ^  ^
                 |  |  |
                 +--+--+---------- Count of '1' is 3.

Is 4 > 3.5? Yes.
Is 3 > 3.5? No.

So, our majority element is 2.
```

#### **List the Tricky Cases (Edge Cases)**

We should always think about special situations to make sure our code doesn't break.

  * **List with only one number:** If the input is `[5]`, the size is 1. "More than half" is `1 / 2 = 0.5`. The number `5` appears 1 time, which is more than 0.5. So, the answer is `5`.
  * **The majority element appears at the end:** `[1, 1, 2, 2, 2]`. The answer is `2`. Our code shouldn't just stop early; it needs to check the whole list.
  * **Negative numbers:** The list can contain negative numbers, like `[-1, -1, -1, 2, 3]`. The logic is the same. Here, `-1` is the majority element.

-----
### **Step 2: The First, Simple Solution (The Brute-Force Way)**

We'll start with the most obvious and straightforward approach. It might not be the fastest, but it's the easiest to think of, which makes it a great starting point.

#### **Explain the Simple Idea**

The simplest idea is to just do what we did in our story:

1.  Pick the first number in the list.
2.  Go through the *entire* list from beginning to end and count how many times our chosen number appears.
3.  After counting, check if that count is "more than half" the list's size.
4.  If it is, we found our answer\! We can stop and return that number.
5.  If it's not, we move to the *second* number in the list and repeat the whole process: count how many times *it* appears in the entire list and check if it's the majority.
6.  We continue this until we find the winner. Since the problem guarantees a majority element always exists, we are sure to find it eventually.

This is called "brute-force" because we are using pure muscle—no clever tricks, just checking every possibility.

#### **Write the C++ Code**

Here is the C++ code that does exactly what we just described.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    int majorityElement(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        // WHY: We need to know the total size of the list to find the "halfway" point.
        int n = nums.size();
        
        // WHY: This is the threshold a count must beat to be the majority.
        // For example, if n=7, majority_count must be > 3.5. So an integer count must be 4 or more.
        int majority_count = n / 2;

        // WHY: This is our first loop. It picks one number at a time to be our "candidate".
        // 'i' will be 0, then 1, then 2, and so on, for each element in the list.
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            
            // WHY: For each candidate number, we need a counter that starts fresh at 0.
            int count = 0;

            // WHY: This is our second, inner loop. Its job is to count the occurrences
            // of the number we picked in the outer loop (nums[i]).
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                
                // WHY: We compare every number in the list (nums[j]) to our candidate (nums[i]).
                if (nums[j] == nums[i]) {
                    // WHY: If they match, we increase our counter.
                    count++;
                }
            }

            // WHY: After the inner loop finishes counting, we check if the count is
            // greater than the halfway mark.
            if (count > majority_count) {
                // WHY: If it is, we've found the majority element! We can return it and stop.
                return nums[i];
            }
        }

        // WHY: We should never reach this point because the problem guarantees
        // a majority element always exists. But C++ requires a return value.
        // Returning -1 is a common way to signal an error or unexpected state.
        return -1; 
    }
};
```

#### **Show a Detailed "Dry Run"**

Let's walk through an example: `nums = [3, 2, 3]`.
The size `n` is 3. The `majority_count` is `3 / 2 = 1`. So we need a number that appears more than 1 time.

**Outer Loop (i = 0):**

  - Our candidate number is `nums[0]`, which is `3`.
  - We reset `count` to `0`.
  - **Inner Loop starts (j = 0 to 2):**
      - `j=0`: Is `nums[0]` (`3`) equal to our candidate (`3`)? Yes. `count` becomes `1`.
      - `j=1`: Is `nums[1]` (`2`) equal to our candidate (`3`)? No.
      - `j=2`: Is `nums[2]` (`3`) equal to our candidate (`3`)? Yes. `count` becomes `2`.
  - **Inner Loop ends.** The final `count` for the number `3` is `2`.
  - **Check:** Is `count` (which is `2`) \> `majority_count` (which is `1`)? Yes, it is\!
  - **We found it\!** The code returns our candidate, `3`. The function is done.

We didn't even need to check the rest of the numbers. The first one we tried was a winner.

#### **Analyze Speed and Memory (The Easy Way)**

  * **Time (Speed):**
    To figure out the speed, we look at the loops. We have a loop inside another loop.
    The outer loop runs `n` times (where `n` is the number of elements in the list).
    For *each* of those `n` times, the inner loop *also* runs `n` times.
    So, the total number of checks we do is roughly $n \\times n$, or $N^2$. This is called **$O(N^2)$ time complexity**. If the list has 10,000 numbers, we'd do about $10,000 \\times 10,000 = 100,000,000$ operations. That is very slow\!

  * **Space (Memory):**
    To figure out the memory, we look at how much extra storage we created. We made a few variables like `n`, `majority_count`, `i`, `j`, and `count`. These are just single numbers. We didn't create a big new list or anything complex. The amount of extra memory doesn't change no matter how big the input list gets. This is called **constant space**, or **$O(1)$**. This is very good\!

So, this solution is good on memory, but bad on speed.

-----

### **Step 4: The Smart Solution (The Optimized Code)**

Now we'll write the C++ code for our new, faster approach using a hash map.

#### **Write the Optimized C++ Code**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map> // WHY: We need to include this header to use the hash map data structure.

class Solution {
public:
    int majorityElement(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        // WHY: A hash map to store the frequency of each number.
        // The key is the number from the list (int), and the value is its count (int).
        std::unordered_map<int, int> counts;
        
        // WHY: We still need the size to know what "half" is.
        int n = nums.size();
        int majority_count = n / 2;

        // WHY: A single loop to go through the list just once.
        // This is much better than two nested loops.
        for (int num : nums) {
            // WHY: For each number 'num' from the list, we increase its count in the map.
            // If the number isn't in the map yet, C++ automatically adds it with a count of 0 before adding 1.
            counts[num]++;

            // WHY: After increasing the count, we immediately check if this number
            // has become the majority element. This lets us stop as early as possible.
            if (counts[num] > majority_count) {
                // WHY: If the count is greater than half, we've found our answer. Return it.
                return num;
            }
        }

        // WHY: Like before, this part should not be reached because an answer always exists.
        return -1;
    }
};
```

#### **Give a Simple Analogy**

This technique is called **Using a Hash Map for Counting Frequencies**.

Think of it like being a vote counter in an election. You have a pile of ballots (the `nums` list). Instead of recounting the whole pile for each candidate, you have a tally sheet (the `unordered_map`). As you pick up each ballot, you just put a tally mark next to the right candidate's name. This is exactly what our code is doing: `counts[num]++` is our way of making a tally mark. It's fast, organized, and efficient.

#### **Show the "Dry Run"**

Let's trace our faster solution with `nums = [2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]`.
`n` is 7, `majority_count` is `7 / 2 = 3`. We need a count \> 3.

  - **Start:** `counts` map is empty `{}`.
  - **Loop 1:** `num` is `2`.
      - Increment count for `2`. `counts` is now `{ 2 -> 1 }`.
      - Is `counts[2]` (which is 1) \> 3? No.
  - **Loop 2:** `num` is `2`.
      - Increment count for `2`. `counts` is now `{ 2 -> 2 }`.
      - Is `counts[2]` (which is 2) \> 3? No.
  - **Loop 3:** `num` is `1`.
      - Increment count for `1`. `counts` is now `{ 2 -> 2, 1 -> 1 }`.
      - Is `counts[1]` (which is 1) \> 3? No.
  - **Loop 4:** `num` is `1`.
      - Increment count for `1`. `counts` is now `{ 2 -> 2, 1 -> 2 }`.
      - Is `counts[1]` (which is 2) \> 3? No.
  - **Loop 5:** `num` is `1`.
      - Increment count for `1`. `counts` is now `{ 2 -> 2, 1 -> 3 }`.
      - Is `counts[1]` (which is 3) \> 3? No.
  - **Loop 6:** `num` is `2`.
      - Increment count for `2`. `counts` is now `{ 2 -> 3, 1 -> 3 }`.
      - Is `counts[2]` (which is 3) \> 3? No.
  - **Loop 7:** `num` is `2`.
      - Increment count for `2`. `counts` is now `{ 2 -> 4, 1 -> 3 }`.
      - Is `counts[2]` (which is 4) \> 3? **Yes\!**
      - The function immediately returns `2`.

See how we only went through the list once? Much faster\!

#### **Compare Speed and Memory**

Let's compare this to our first solution.

  * **Time (Speed):**

      * **Brute-Force:** $O(N^2)$ — Very slow for large lists.
      * **Hash Map:** $O(N)$ — We only loop through the list one time. This is a **huge** improvement. If the list has 10,000 items, this is about 10,000 steps, not 100 million\!

  * **Space (Memory):**

      * **Brute-Force:** $O(1)$ — We used almost no extra memory.
      * **Hash Map:** $O(K)$ — The hash map needs to store one entry for each *unique* number in the list. Let's say there are `K` unique numbers. In the worst case, every number could be unique (except the majority one), so the space could be close to $O(N)$. We traded some memory to gain a lot of speed. This is a very common and smart trade-off in programming.

### **The Pro Solution: Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm**

#### **The "Aha\!" Idea**

The key insight is this: since the majority element appears **more than half the time**, it means its count is greater than the counts of **all other elements combined**.

Think of it as a battle. Let's say our list is `[A, A, B, C, A]`. 'A' is the majority.

  - If we pair up one 'A' with one 'B', they "cancel each other out".
  - If we pair up another 'A' with one 'C', they also cancel out.
  - After all the non-A's are gone, there will *still* be at least one 'A' left over.

The algorithm uses this idea of "canceling out". We will have one `candidate` for the majority element and a `count`.

1.  We pick the first number as our `candidate` and set its `count` to 1.
2.  We then walk through the rest of the list.
      - If we see the same number as our `candidate`, we **increase** the `count`.
      - If we see a different number, we **decrease** the `count`.
3.  If the `count` ever drops to `0`, it means our current `candidate` has been completely "canceled out". We then pick the *very next number* we see as our new `candidate` and reset the `count` to 1.

Because the true majority element has more members than everyone else combined, it's guaranteed to be the final `candidate` standing at the end.

#### **Write the C++ Code**

Here is what this clever idea looks like in code. Notice how simple it is\!

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    int majorityElement(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        // WHY: We need a variable to keep track of our current candidate for the majority element.
        int candidate = 0;
        // WHY: This is the counter for our candidate. It goes up when we see the candidate,
        // and down when we see a different number.
        int count = 0;

        // WHY: We loop through the list just once.
        for (int num : nums) {
            // WHY: If count is 0, it means our previous candidate was "canceled out".
            // So, we pick the current number as our new candidate.
            if (count == 0) {
                candidate = num;
            }

            // WHY: If the current number is the same as our candidate, we increment the count.
            // If it's a different number, we decrement the count (they cancel out).
            if (num == candidate) {
                count++;
            } else {
                count--;
            }
        }
        
        // WHY: The algorithm guarantees that the number left as the candidate at the end
        // must be the majority element.
        return candidate;
    }
};
```

#### **Show the "Dry Run"**

Let's trace this with our example: `nums = [2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]`.

  - **Start:** `count` is `0`, `candidate` is not set yet.
  - **Loop 1:** `num` is `2`.
      - `count` is `0`, so we set `candidate = 2`.
      - `num` (`2`) == `candidate` (`2`), so we set `count = 1`.
      - *(State: `candidate`=2, `count`=1)*
  - **Loop 2:** `num` is `2`.
      - `num` (`2`) == `candidate` (`2`), so we set `count = 2`.
      - *(State: `candidate`=2, `count`=2)*
  - **Loop 3:** `num` is `1`.
      - `num` (`1`) \!= `candidate` (`2`), so we set `count = 1`.
      - *(State: `candidate`=2, `count`=1)*
  - **Loop 4:** `num` is `1`.
      - `num` (`1`) \!= `candidate` (`2`), so we set `count = 0`.
      - *(State: `candidate`=2, `count`=0)* --- The `2`'s have been canceled out\!
  - **Loop 5:** `num` is `1`.
      - `count` is `0`, so we set `candidate = 1`.
      - `num` (`1`) == `candidate` (`1`), so we set `count = 1`.
      - *(State: `candidate`=1, `count`=1)* --- `1` is our new leader.
  - **Loop 6:** `num` is `2`.
      - `num` (`2`) \!= `candidate` (`1`), so we set `count = 0`.
      - *(State: `candidate`=1, `count`=0)*
  - **Loop 7:** `num` is `2`.
      - `count` is `0`, so we set `candidate = 2`.
      - `num` (`2`) == `candidate` (`2`), so we set `count = 1`.
      - *(State: `candidate`=2, `count`=1)*

The loop finishes. The final `candidate` is `2`. The function returns `2`.

#### **Analyze Speed and Memory**

  * **Time (Speed):** We still go through the list just one time. So the speed is **$O(N)$**.
  * **Space (Memory):** Look at the variables we created: `candidate` and `count`. That's it\! Just two variables. The memory usage does not depend on the size of the input list at all. This is **$O(1)$ space complexity**.

We have found the Holy Grail: a solution that is both lightning-fast and uses almost no extra memory.

### **Step 5: How to Explain Your Solution (The Interview Plan)**

When an interviewer asks you to solve this, they want to see your thought process. Explaining the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm clearly will be very impressive. Here is a simple template you can follow.

---

#### **Your Explanation Template**

**1. The Goal:**
"The problem asks me to find the element in a list that appears more than `n / 2` times. The key constraint is that this majority element is guaranteed to exist."

**2. My Solution Idea:**
"My approach is to use a very efficient method called the **Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm**. The core idea is that if we 'cancel out' every occurrence of the majority element with an occurrence of a non-majority element, the majority element will still be the last one remaining at the end."

**3. How It Works:**
"I'll walk through the list just once, keeping track of two things: a `candidate` number and a `count`.
- I start with a count of zero. When the count is zero, I'll pick the current number as my new candidate.
- If the current number matches my candidate, I increase the count.
- If it's a different number, I decrease the count.
By the end of the list, the number that is left as the candidate is guaranteed to be the majority element."

**4. Performance:**
"This solution is optimal because:
- Its **time complexity is $O(N)$**. We only need to iterate through the list a single time.
- Its **space complexity is $O(1)$**. We only use two extra variables (`candidate` and `count`), regardless of how big the input list is."

**5. Tricky Cases:**
"My solution relies on the problem's guarantee that a majority element always exists. If that weren't the case, I would need to add a second pass at the end to verify that the final candidate's count is truly greater than `n / 2`."

---
### **Step 6: Key Lessons and Future Problems**

#### **The Main Pattern**

The key pattern for the most optimal solution here was the **Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm**. It's a classic example of a clever algorithm that avoids the need for extra memory by using a simple but powerful insight about the problem's constraints.

The main takeaway is that for problems involving finding frequent items, don't just stop at the hash map solution. Always ask yourself, "Can I do this with less memory?" Sometimes, a special property of the problem (like an item appearing *more than half* the time) unlocks a more creative and efficient solution.

#### **Clues for Next Time**

How do you spot when to use this pattern in the future? Look for these clues in the problem description:

* The problem asks you to find an element that appears **more than `n / k` times** (in our case, `k` was 2).
* You are specifically asked for a solution with **$O(1)$ space complexity**, which makes a hash map (which uses $O(N)$ space) not an option.
* The words **"majority," "frequency,"** or **"most common"** are used.

When you see these clues, the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm should immediately come to mind.

#### **One More Problem**

To really master this pattern, a great next problem to try is **[229. Majority Element II]**.

This problem asks you to find all elements that appear **more than `n / 3` times**. It's a fantastic follow-up because you can't use the exact same code, but you can adapt the *same core idea* of voting and canceling out to solve it. It will force you to think about what happens when you need to track more than one candidate.
