### **Step 1: Understanding the Problem (Breaking It Down)**

Before we write any code, we must understand exactly what the problem is asking. Let's break it down into simple pieces.

#### **Tell a Simple Story**

Imagine you have a line of gumball machines. Each machine gives you some gumballs. Some might even take gumballs away (if the number is negative\!). You have a special box that can only hold gumballs in groups of `k`.

Your goal is to find out how many **consecutive groups of machines** you can use so that the total number of gumballs you get is a perfect multiple of `k`. This means you can put all the gumballs from that group into your special boxes with none left over.

For example, if `k` is 5, you're looking for groups of machines that give you a total of 5, 10, 15, 0, or even -5, -10 gumballs.

#### **Explain the Parts**

  * **Inputs (What we get):**

    1.  `nums`: A list of numbers (integers). This is like the line of gumball machines, where each number tells you how many gumballs that machine gives or takes.
    2.  `k`: A single number (an integer). This is the size of the groups your special box can hold.

  * **Output (What we must return):**

      * A single number. This number is the **count** of all the subarrays whose sum is perfectly divisible by `k`.

  * **Goal (The main task):**

      * Find every single **subarray** (a continuous block of elements) in `nums`.
      * Calculate the sum of the numbers in that subarray.
      * Check if that sum can be divided by `k` with a remainder of 0.
      * Count how many times this happens.

#### **Show with a Drawing**

Let's use a simple example to see this in action.
`nums = [4, 5, 0, -2]` and `k = 5`

A **subarray** is a piece of the list that is connected.

```
nums: [ 4, 5, 0, -2 ]
```

Let's check some of the possible subarrays:

  * `[4]` -\> sum is 4. Is `4` divisible by `5`? No.
  * `[5]` -\> sum is 5. Is `5` divisible by `5`? **Yes**. (Count = 1)
  * `[4, 5]` -\> sum is 9. Is `9` divisible by `5`? No.
  * `[5, 0]` -\> sum is 5. Is `5` divisible by `5`? **Yes**. (Count = 2)
  * `[0]` -\> sum is 0. Is `0` divisible by `5`? **Yes**. (Count = 3)
  * `[4, 5, 0]` -\> sum is 9. Is `9` divisible by `5`? No.
  * `[0, -2]` -\> sum is -2. Is `-2` divisible by `5`? No.
  * `[5, 0, -2]` -\> sum is 3. Is `3` divisible by `5`? No.

...and so on, until we check all possible continuous blocks.

#### **List the Tricky Cases (Edge Cases)**

We need to be careful about a few special situations:

  * **Negative Numbers:** The list `nums` can have negative numbers. The sum can be negative. For example, if the sum is -10 and `k` is 5, the sum is divisible\!
  * **Zeroes:** The list `nums` can have zeros. A subarray with a sum of 0 is divisible by any `k`.
  * **Empty List:** What if the `nums` list is empty? There are no subarrays, so the answer should be 0.
  * **The value of `k`:** The problem states `k` will be 2 or greater, so we don't have to worry about `k` being 0 or 1.

-----
### **Step 2: The First, Simple Solution (The Brute-Force Way)**

The most direct way to solve any problem is usually to just "do what it says." The problem asks us to check all subarrays, so let's do exactly that\! We will check every single possible subarray one by one.

#### **Explain the Simple Idea**

Here is the step-by-step logic:

1.  We need a way to look at all possible subarrays. A subarray is defined by its starting point and its ending point.
2.  We can use a loop (let's call its variable `i`) to select the **starting position** of our subarray. This loop will go from the first element to the last.
3.  Inside that loop, we'll start another loop (let's call its variable `j`) to select the **ending position**. This second loop will start from where `i` is and go to the end of the list.
4.  This `i` and `j` pair now defines one subarray.
5.  As the inner loop runs, we'll keep a running `currentSum` for the subarray from `i` to `j`.
6.  For each subarray we form, we'll calculate its sum and check if `currentSum % k == 0`.
7.  If the sum is divisible by `k`, we'll increment a counter.
8.  After the loops have checked every single possible start and end position, the counter will hold our final answer.

#### **Write the C++ Code**

Here is the C++ code that follows this simple logic.

```cpp
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    int subarraysDivByK(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        // WHY: This variable will store our final answer. We start the count at 0.
        int count = 0;
        int n = nums.size();

        // WHY: This outer loop selects the STARTING index of our subarray.
        // It goes from the beginning (index 0) to the end of the list.
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            
            // WHY: This variable holds the sum of the current subarray that starts at index 'i'.
            // We reset it for every new starting position.
            int currentSum = 0;

            // WHY: This inner loop selects the ENDING index of our subarray.
            // It starts from our chosen starting index 'i' and goes to the end of the list.
            for (int j = i; j < n; ++j) {
                
                // WHY: We expand our subarray by one element (at index 'j') and add its value to the sum.
                currentSum += nums[j];

                // WHY: This is the main check. We use the modulo operator (%) to get the remainder.
                // If the remainder of the sum divided by k is 0, the sum is divisible.
                if (currentSum % k == 0) {
                    // WHY: If it's divisible, we've found a valid subarray, so we increment our counter.
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }

        // WHY: After the loops have finished, 'count' holds the total number
        // of subarrays whose sum is divisible by k. We return it.
        return count;
    }
};
```

#### **Show a Detailed "Dry Run"**

Let's trace the code with our example: `nums = [4, 5, 0]` and `k = 5`.

  * `count` starts at `0`.
  * **Outer loop starts: `i = 0`** (Our subarray will start at `nums[0]`, which is `4`).
      * `currentSum` is reset to `0`.
      * **Inner loop starts:**
          * **`j = 0`:** The subarray is `[4]`.
              * `currentSum` becomes `0 + 4 = 4`.
              * Is `4 % 5 == 0`? No.
          * **`j = 1`:** The subarray is `[4, 5]`.
              * `currentSum` becomes `4 + 5 = 9`.
              * Is `9 % 5 == 0`? No.
          * **`j = 2`:** The subarray is `[4, 5, 0]`.
              * `currentSum` becomes `9 + 0 = 9`.
              * Is `9 % 5 == 0`? No.
      * Inner loop finishes for `i = 0`.
  * **Outer loop continues: `i = 1`** (Our subarray will start at `nums[1]`, which is `5`).
      * `currentSum` is reset to `0`.
      * **Inner loop starts:**
          * **`j = 1`:** The subarray is `[5]`.
              * `currentSum` becomes `0 + 5 = 5`.
              * Is `5 % 5 == 0`? **Yes**. `count` is now `1`.
          * **`j = 2`:** The subarray is `[5, 0]`.
              * `currentSum` becomes `5 + 0 = 5`.
              * Is `5 % 5 == 0`? **Yes**. `count` is now `2`.
      * Inner loop finishes for `i = 1`.
  * **Outer loop continues: `i = 2`** (Our subarray will start at `nums[2]`, which is `0`).
      * `currentSum` is reset to `0`.
      * **Inner loop starts:**
          * **`j = 2`:** The subarray is `[0]`.
              * `currentSum` becomes `0 + 0 = 0`.
              * Is `0 % 5 == 0`? **Yes**. `count` is now `3`.
      * Inner loop finishes for `i = 2`.
  * Outer loop finishes. The final `count` is `3`. We return `3`.

#### **Analyze Speed and Memory (The Easy Way)**

  * **Time (Speed):** We have a loop inside another loop.

      * The outer loop runs `N` times (where `N` is the number of items in `nums`).
      * The inner loop also runs about `N` times for each outer loop run (sometimes less, but on average, it's proportional to `N`).
      * This means the total number of operations is roughly $N \\times N$, or $N^2$. We write this as **Time Complexity: $O(N^2)$**.
      * If `nums` has 30,000 elements, $N^2$ is 900,000,000. This is a lot of operations and will be too slow for the time limits on most platforms.

  * **Space (Memory):**

      * We created a few variables like `count`, `n`, `i`, `j`, and `currentSum`.
      * The amount of extra memory we use does not depend on the size of the input list `nums`. It's always just a few variables.
      * Therefore, the extra memory is constant. We write this as **Space Complexity: $O(1)$**.

-----
### **Step 3: Thinking Towards a Better Way (The Expert's Thought Process)**

#### **Find the Slow Part**

The brute-force solution is slow because of the **nested loops**.

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {       // This loop runs N times
    int currentSum = 0;
    for (int j = i; j < n; ++j) {   // This loop also runs up to N times
        currentSum += nums[j];      // <-- The work is repeated here!
        // ...
    }
}
```

The problem is the `currentSum += nums[j]` line. We are calculating sums over and over again. For example, when we calculate the sum of `[4, 5, 0]`, we add `4+5+0`. In the next step, when we calculate the sum of `[5, 0]`, we add `5+0`. We've already calculated `5+0` as part of the previous sum\! This repeated work is what we need to eliminate.

An expert asks: **"How can we calculate subarray sums without adding up all the elements every single time?"**

The answer is a powerful technique called **Prefix Sums**.

#### **Reveal the "Aha\!" Idea**

Let's define a `prefixSum` as the sum of all numbers from the very beginning of the list up to a certain point.

For `nums = [4, 5, 0, -2]`:

  * `prefixSum` at index 0 is `4`
  * `prefixSum` at index 1 is `4 + 5 = 9`
  * `prefixSum` at index 2 is `4 + 5 + 0 = 9`
  * `prefixSum` at index 3 is `4 + 5 + 0 + (-2) = 7`

Now, if we want the sum of the subarray from index `i` to `j`, we can just do: `sum(i, j) = prefixSum[j] - prefixSum[i-1]`.

  * **Example:** Sum of `[5, 0]` (from index 1 to 2)
      * `prefixSum[2]` is `9`.
      * `prefixSum[0]` (the one right before our subarray starts) is `4`.
      * `sum(1, 2) = prefixSum[2] - prefixSum[0] = 9 - 4 = 5`. It works\!

So, our goal changes. We are looking for pairs of indices `i` and `j` where `(prefixSum[j] - prefixSum[i-1]) % k == 0`.

Here comes the biggest "Aha\!" moment, which comes from a rule in mathematics (modular arithmetic):

> `(A - B)` is divisible by `k` if and only if `A` and `B` have the **same remainder** when divided by `k`.

For example, `(17 - 2)` is `15`, which is divisible by 5.

  * `17 % 5` gives a remainder of `2`.
  * `2 % 5` gives a remainder of `2`.
    They have the same remainder\!

So, our goal becomes even simpler:
**We need to find pairs of prefix sums that have the same remainder when divided by `k`.**

This leads to a new, much faster plan:

1.  Go through the `nums` list just **once**.
2.  Keep track of the `prefixSum` as we go.
3.  At each element, calculate the remainder of the current `prefixSum`: `remainder = prefixSum % k`.
4.  Now, we ask: "How many times have we seen this *exact* remainder before?"
5.  If we've seen this remainder, say, 3 times already, it means there are 3 previous positions we can pair with our current position to form 3 new valid subarrays.
6.  To instantly look up how many times we've seen a remainder, we can use a **Hash Map** (or a simple array). The remainder is the key, and the count is the value.

#### **Draw the New Idea**

Let's trace this new idea. `nums = [4, 5, 0, -2, -3, 1]`, `k = 5`.
We'll use a map called `remainderCounts` to store the frequency of each remainder.

**Important Trick:** We must initialize our map with a remainder of `0` having a count of `1`. So, `remainderCounts = {0: 1}`. This is to correctly count subarrays that start from the very beginning of the array. Think of it as a "prefix sum of 0" existing before the array even starts.

Let's begin.
`prefixSum = 0`, `totalCount = 0`, `remainderCounts = {0: 1}`

1.  **`num = 4`**

      * `prefixSum` becomes `0 + 4 = 4`.
      * `remainder = 4 % 5 = 4`.
      * How many times have we seen remainder `4` before? The map says `0`.
      * So, `totalCount += 0`.
      * Update map: We've now seen remainder `4` once. `remainderCounts = {0: 1, 4: 1}`.

2.  **`num = 5`**

      * `prefixSum` becomes `4 + 5 = 9`.
      * `remainder = 9 % 5 = 4`.
      * How many times have we seen remainder `4` before? The map says `1`.
      * So, `totalCount += 1`. (`totalCount` is now `1`). This found the subarray `[5]`.
      * Update map: We've now seen remainder `4` a second time. `remainderCounts = {0: 1, 4: 2}`.

3.  **`num = 0`**

      * `prefixSum` becomes `9 + 0 = 9`.
      * `remainder = 9 % 5 = 4`.
      * How many times have we seen remainder `4` before? The map says `2`.
      * So, `totalCount += 2`. (`totalCount` is now `1 + 2 = 3`). This found subarrays `[5, 0]` and `[4, 5, 0]`.
      * Update map: We've now seen remainder `4` a third time. `remainderCounts = {0: 1, 4: 3}`.

This approach lets us find the answer by walking through the list only one time\!

-----

### **Step 4: The Smart Solution (The Optimized Code)**

We will now build the solution using the Prefix Sum and Remainder Counting strategy. Instead of a hash map, we can use a simple array of size `k` to store the counts of the remainders, as we know the remainders will always be in the range `0` to `k-1`. This is a common and efficient optimization.

#### **Write the Optimized C++ Code**

```cpp
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    int subarraysDivByK(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        // WHY: An array to store the frequency of each remainder. The index of the array
        // (0 to k-1) represents the remainder itself. This is faster than a hash map.
        std::vector<int> remainderCounts(k, 0);

        // WHY: The most important starting step. We've seen a remainder of 0 one time
        // before we even start the loop (from a conceptual prefix sum of 0).
        // This correctly handles subarrays that start at index 0.
        remainderCounts[0] = 1;

        int count = 0;      // WHY: This will be our final answer.
        int prefixSum = 0;  // WHY: Holds the running sum from the beginning of the array.

        // WHY: We only loop through the array ONCE. This is the key to the speed-up.
        for (int num : nums) {
            // WHY: Add the current number to our running sum.
            prefixSum += num;

            // WHY: Calculate the remainder.
            int remainder = prefixSum % k;

            // WHY: This is a crucial fix. In C++, taking the modulo of a negative number
            // can result in a negative remainder (e.g., -2 % 5 = -2). We need a positive
            // remainder (0 to k-1) to use as an index in our array.
            // Adding k makes any negative remainder positive (e.g., -2 + 5 = 3).
            if (remainder < 0) {
                remainder += k;
            }

            // WHY: The main logic! The value at remainderCounts[remainder] tells us how many
            // times we have seen this remainder before. Each of those previous occurrences
            // can pair with our current position to form a new subarray whose sum is divisible by k.
            count += remainderCounts[remainder];

            // WHY: We've now seen this remainder one more time at the current position.
            // We increment its count in our array so it can be used by future elements.
            remainderCounts[remainder]++;
        }

        return count;
    }
};
```

#### **Give a Simple Analogy**

This pattern is called **Prefix Sums with Counting**.

Think of it like this: You're walking on a numbered line, and at each step, you calculate your `prefixSum`. You have `k` different colored paints. The color you use at each spot is determined by `prefixSum % k`.

Every time you are about to paint a spot, you first look back and count how many spots are already painted with that *same color*. That count is the number of new valid "journeys" (subarrays) you just completed. Then, you paint your current spot with its color.

#### **Show the "Dry Run"**

Let's trace the optimized code with `nums = [4, 5, 0, -2, -3, 1]` and `k = 5`.

  * **Initial State:**

      * `remainderCounts` array (size 5) = `[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
      * `count = 0`
      * `prefixSum = 0`

  * **Loop 1: `num = 4`**

      * `prefixSum` = `0 + 4 = 4`
      * `remainder` = `4 % 5 = 4`
      * `count += remainderCounts[4]` (which is 0). `count` is still `0`.
      * `remainderCounts[4]++`. `remainderCounts` is now `[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]`.

  * **Loop 2: `num = 5`**

      * `prefixSum` = `4 + 5 = 9`
      * `remainder` = `9 % 5 = 4`
      * `count += remainderCounts[4]` (which is 1). `count` is now `1`.
      * `remainderCounts[4]++`. `remainderCounts` is now `[1, 0, 0, 0, 2]`.

  * **Loop 3: `num = 0`**

      * `prefixSum` = `9 + 0 = 9`
      * `remainder` = `9 % 5 = 4`
      * `count += remainderCounts[4]` (which is 2). `count` is now `1 + 2 = 3`.
      * `remainderCounts[4]++`. `remainderCounts` is now `[1, 0, 0, 0, 3]`.

  * **Loop 4: `num = -2`**

      * `prefixSum` = `9 + (-2) = 7`
      * `remainder` = `7 % 5 = 2`
      * `count += remainderCounts[2]` (which is 0). `count` is still `3`.
      * `remainderCounts[2]++`. `remainderCounts` is now `[1, 0, 1, 0, 3]`.

  * **Loop 5: `num = -3`**

      * `prefixSum` = `7 + (-3) = 4`
      * `remainder` = `4 % 5 = 4`
      * `count += remainderCounts[4]` (which is 3). `count` is now `3 + 3 = 6`.
      * `remainderCounts[4]++`. `remainderCounts` is now `[1, 0, 1, 0, 4]`.

  * **Loop 6: `num = 1`**

      * `prefixSum` = `4 + 1 = 5`
      * `remainder` = `5 % 5 = 0`
      * `count += remainderCounts[0]` (which is 1). `count` is now `6 + 1 = 7`.
      * `remainderCounts[0]++`. `remainderCounts` is now `[2, 0, 1, 0, 4]`.

  * **End of Loop:** The function returns `count`, which is `7`.

#### **Compare Speed and Memory**

|           | Brute-Force Solution      | Optimized Solution     |
| :-------- | :------------------------ | :--------------------- |
| **Time** | $O(N^2)$ (Slow)           | $O(N)$ (Very Fast)     |
| **Space** | $O(1)$ (Very little memory) | $O(k)$ (A little memory) |

We made a **trade-off**. We used a little bit of extra memory (an array of size `k`) to make our algorithm dramatically faster. For a list of 30,000 items, we went from \~900 million steps to just \~30,000 steps. This is a huge win\!

-----

### **Step 5: How to Explain Your Solution (The Interview Plan)**

Here is a simple, clear template you can follow to explain your solution. Think of this as your script.

**(Start by taking a breath and organizing your thoughts.)**

**1. The Goal:**
"The goal of this problem is to count the number of contiguous subarrays whose elements sum up to a multiple of `k`. This means the sum is perfectly divisible by `k` with no remainder."

**2. My Solution Idea:**
"A simple, brute-force approach would be to generate every possible subarray, calculate its sum, and check for divisibility. However, this would be too slow, with a time complexity of $O(N^2)$.

A much more efficient approach is to use the mathematical properties of remainders. My strategy uses **prefix sums** combined with a **frequency map** (or an array) to solve the problem in a single pass."

**3. How It Works:**
"The core insight is this: the sum of a subarray from index `i` to `j` is `prefixSum[j] - prefixSum[i-1]`. This difference is divisible by `k` if and only if `prefixSum[j]` and `prefixSum[i-1]` have the exact same remainder when divided by `k`.

So, my algorithm works like this:
* I iterate through the input array just one time, maintaining a running `prefixSum`.
* At each element, I calculate the remainder of the current `prefixSum` with respect to `k`.
* I use an array of size `k` to keep track of how many times I've seen each remainder so far.
* When I calculate a new remainder, I look it up in my frequency array. The count stored there tells me how many valid subarrays end at my current position. I add this count to my total result.
* Finally, I increment the frequency count for the current remainder to include it for future calculations."

**4. Performance:**
"This solution is very efficient:
* The **time complexity is $O(N)$**, because I only need to iterate through the input array once.
* The **space complexity is $O(k)$**, because I use an auxiliary array of size `k` to store the frequencies of the remainders."

**5. Tricky Cases:**
"I also made sure to handle two important edge cases:
* First, the modulo operator in C++ can produce negative results for negative inputs. I handle this by adding `k` to any negative remainder to map it back to the positive range `[0, k-1]`.
* Second, to correctly count subarrays that start from index 0, I initialize the frequency of remainder `0` to `1` before the loop begins. This accounts for an empty prefix before the array starts."

### **Step 6: Key Lessons and Future Problems**

Every problem teaches us a reusable "pattern" or "technique." Recognizing these patterns is the secret to becoming a great problem-solver.

#### **The Main Pattern**

The key pattern here was using **Prefix Sums with a Frequency Map (or Array)**.

This is a classic and powerful technique. It allows you to answer questions about the sums of ranges (or subarrays) in an array very, very quickly. It's the standard way to optimize problems that involve subarray sums from a slow $O(N^2)$ solution to a fast $O(N)$ one.

#### **Clues for Next Time**

How do you know when to use this pattern again? Look for these clues in the problem description:

* The problem asks you to find a **"subarray"** or a **"contiguous range"**.
* The condition is about the **"sum"** of that subarray.
* The condition is something like "find a subarray whose sum equals `X`," or "whose sum is a multiple of `k`," or "whose sum has property `Y`."

When you see these clues, your first thought should be:
*"The brute-force way is too slow. I should try using **prefix sums**. To make that fast, I'll probably need a **hash map** to store and quickly look up information about the prefix sums I've seen before."*

#### **One More Problem**

The best way to make a lesson stick is to practice it immediately. Here is a perfect practice problem that uses the *exact same pattern*:

**[560. Subarray Sum Equals K]**

This problem asks you to find the number of subarrays whose sum is *exactly* equal to `k`. The prefix sum and hash map technique you just learned is the ideal way to solve it. Give it a try when you're ready!
